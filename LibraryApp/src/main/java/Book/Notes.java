    * Servlet is an Api that translates http to thw JVM
    * You need to implement a servlet interface in 3 ways
        * Directly eg implements servlet
        * By extending a generic servlet eg extends GenericServlet
        * By extending htp servlet eg extends HTTPServlet
        *
        * Servlet methods
        *   Init - used to initiate the servlet
        *   Service
        * Destroy - Destroys service if u want
        *
        * Parameters that are passed in the url is called query parameters.
        *
        * Servlet contexts is an object that is created once for the whole package, It has servlet events and servlet listeners.
        *  It gets requests in the service method and will translate for you.
        *
        * Observer design patterns
        *   It listens to events in an object and can do something to it.
